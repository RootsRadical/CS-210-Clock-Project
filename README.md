SNHU CS-210 Project 1 

For this project, we were asked to create an application that ran two separate clocks at the same time. One showing standard 
time and the other showing military time. The clocks can be updated on their own or by user input. 
This was the first project I had ever written in C++ and the first time I attempted to utilize OOP practices. Writing out the 
different kinds of files such as the cpp and the header helped me start to understand the fundamentals of OOP.
